## Description
The Medical Assistant is a published skill on the Alexa Skill store. It uses APIs to fetch and calculate what is the medical condition a patient is experiencing by taking the symptops faced as inputs.

## Inspiration
This project is greatly inspired from hardships people face with getting diagnosed when required. Most people do not get a chance at all to get to doctors.
